Lesson Plan
===========

Introduction
------------

- Go round the attendees (including myself) and get them to introduce themselves and answer a couple of questions.
    - What their name is.
    - Whether they've done any coding before and what.
    - How far you've got on the exercises on codecademy.
    - What you'd like to get out of this club.
    - What you use computers for the most (and that includes anything with a microprocessor)
- Do a quick rollcall on resources.
    - How many attendees have firefox, those that don't can they install it?
- As with any new club we need a name. I'm not going to put you one the spot right now but have a think about it.

The Web
-------

Right, we're going to start out our coding adventure with the web. There's no compiler or interpretter to install, we've all got a web browser on our computers and we're all pretty familiar with how to use websites. However, if we're going to be developing web applications we're going to have to be a little more than just familiar with how to use websites, we're going to have to know a little about the web itself.

I'm pretty lazy so the first place I looked to define the world wide web was Wikipedia and they said.

"The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks."

Apart from quite a few cryptic terms in there it's a pretty good start. So let's break it down.

"The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents...": Well that's just saying that there are web pages and they're connected with links. You can click on a link and it will take you somewhere.

"...accessed via the internet.": Well now here it gets a little strange, the Internet is usually described as the same thing as the Web. It's not, the internet is the network protocol used to get the web pages to your computer. It's the way the computers talk to each other.

"With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks.": You all know what a web browser is right? Can you name a few for me? Let's have a little browse around the web and see if we can identify some of the bits we've just mentioned.

What Happens When You Load A Page
---------------------------------

- We're going to type a URL (does anyone know what URL stands for?)
- The our browser, over the internet protocol, asks for that resource
- What it gets back is an HTML document
- The browser then reads and understands that document and and references to other documents it might contain and renders them on the page making this lovely page.

But what's that page made up of.

The Parts of A Web Page
-----------------------

There are three main parts to a web page.

- HTML or HyperText Markup Language to describe the content and structure of the page. What's a heading, which bits belong together.
- CSS or Cascading Style Sheets to describe the presentation. How things look, what color our text and background should be for example.
- Javascript for behaviour. This is the programming language that drives web pages and incedentally is the language you're been learning on codecademy.

So, that's a lot of information I've just thrown at you, this is starting to feel a bit too much like a lesson rather than coding club so let's get down to actually making something!

Starting Out With [jsfiddle.net](jsfiddle.net)
-----------------------------------

Depending on numbers and resources get into groups of two or three.

Right, load up the website [jsfiddle.net](jsfiddle.net). This is a great little web app that lets us easily play around with HTML, CSS and Javascript and see the results right in front of us as we play.

See that in the top left we've got an area we can put HTML in, top right we can CSS, bottom left we've got Javascript and in the bottom right we'll see the result.
