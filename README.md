Coding for Kids Club
====================

Inspired by [mchapman](https://github.com/mchapman/WebDevKeyStage2) this repository is a record of lesson plans,
resources, code samples and findings from starting a coding club for a group of about 7 or 8 kids around 12 years old.

The club is going to start out with a pretty heavy web development focus but from early on is going to take direction
from the attendees themselves (the kids). As an ultimate goal we intent to enter into next year's YRS and WIN!
